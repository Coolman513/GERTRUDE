Some helpful tips:
- You need to be an administrator to create new projects
- Only the assigned staff member and the project owner can mark tasks complete
- Additional staff can be added to individual projects for one-off tasks
- If odd project numbers are needed (project 0, project 7.5, etc) use \`/addpnum\`
- If you need additional assistance, contact coolman513.
